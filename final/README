chat bot talking about weightlifting

for implications, template the input. i.e.
   if == A person is a lifter if the are a powerlifter
   translates to -> lifter(Person) :- powerlifter(Person)

look into stemming to make predicates more consistent

keywords to trigger certain stuff:
   quit - exit the program
   exit - exit the program
   help - print out this list # not implemented yet 


as of dev checkpoint #2 fooad said
use templates for all input
add as many as you can 
some for rules, some for facts
that is good enough
